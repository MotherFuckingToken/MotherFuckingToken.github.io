            <p>You probably built an Ethereum token and think your ICO is special. You believe your parallax-active, smooth scroll site is going to get you fucking million dollar worth of ethereum 
			which you can dump back on the market.</p>

<p>You expect your investor pitch videos built from cheap Fiverr gigs can give crypto enthusiasts a boner because it finally has some cute girls in it holding your Motherfucking Logo. </p>

<h3>Wrong, motherfucker!</h3>
<br><br>

<h2>Let me describe your perfect-ass Defi Presale/ICO :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shitty wordpress theme that is pirated version.</li>
<li>Has some shitty sliders and banners.</li>
<li>Shitty photos taken from stock sites or maybe stolen from internet. </li>
<li>The motherfucker scam whitepaper accessible to every asshole that visits your site.</li>
<li>Big fake claims that are never gonna fulfilled.<br />&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
     

This Shit you staring is legible and gets your fucking point across. <br><br>

<b>Well guess what, motherfucker:</b><br><br>

<p>You. Are. Over-claiming. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website for a token. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece 
of shit? Why the fuck do you need to copy content from 100 tech papers, rephrase it to build your ass whitepaper, ohh the lightpaper, darkpaper, bluepaper, redpaper... <p>

<p>You spent hours drinking beer and added 80 new fake claims to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers ready to throw his money will never 
see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p> </div></div>

           <h3>  It's fucking Honest : </h3> <br> 

<p>This entire page contains no false promises, no assurance of huge returns, no ass commitment of revolutionizing the crypto world.</p>


<p>And did we tell you, we are gonna build the next big motherfucking thing in crypto that is interoperable, can host billions of Dapps which any motherfucker can deploy with single click, and our transaction speeds are in the range of quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion, nonillion, decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion, quattuordecillion, googol, centillion, googolplex transactions per seconds aka TPS.
</p>
<p>Did you seriously pay $100 to some cheapsters who are gonna bump your Bitcointalk ANN every minute manually with 100 different genuine accounts, thinking you are gonna suck that up? You piece of shit.
</p><br>
  
<h3>It's not raising funds for project development</h3> <br>

<p><b>You dumbass.</b></p>

<p> We are gonna build everything claimed above without taking a single dollar from a cock sucker who rants 24 hours on twitter. You know what motherfucker, because you are also not gonna build anything even after raising several million dollars.
</p>
<p>
And no you do not need a flashy motherfucking responsive website to convey your dick plans to scam thousands of people. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.

</p><br><h3>
It fucking works</h3><br>
<p>
Look at this shit. You can read it. that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. </p>
<center><img src="assets/satoshiquote.png" /></center> <br>
<p>
Why waste $1000 to get a whitepaper filled with fucking technical jargons which even the writer and no crypto fucker understands. </P>

<p>Instead pay that money to someone with a donkey pic on twitter that shills scam coins everyday. 
Trust me you are gonna earn more and no one will even ask that money back , bcoz his followers are used to being scammed by fake defi and uniswap exit scams.
</p>

<br><h3>This is an ICO/STO/IEO token website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h3><br>

<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a good coin/token is. </p>
<p>
All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be a simple token  that could be used for paying your bills. </p>
<p>
This is a real, naked ethereum token. Look at it. It's fucking simple and beautiful. It can be transferred from one address to another, can be traded on exchanges , could be sent to the wallet of the motherfucking coffee shop where you grind your ass thinking about the next big scam ICO idea. Yeah, your token will soon gonna replace Sun, moon , ocean, glacier and even God.
</p><br>

<h2>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck!</h2><br>

<p>I'm not actually saying that every shitty token should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with crypto currencies are ones we create ourselves. </p>

<p>"Scammers aren't born by default, they are made by us. Stop following that cunt on twitter with a profile pic of cat/dog/owl/donkey/wolf that posts charts and predictions that are never gonna happen. You son-of-a-bitch!"
</p>
<p>You never know , the person behind that Twitter account with his/her dog pic, doesn't even have an idea about what the fuck crypto is. He might be just good at writing motivational tweets and designing graphs. It’s a case of stupid leading the blind. You paying attention lazy FUCKING CUNTS?
</p>
<p>Stop being a nincompoop running around out there making investment decisions based on little more than a few cocksure assumptions, and then fucking everything up like me.
</p><br>

<h3>Marketing My Ass</h3><br>

<p>And why the heck do you need to invest 1 million dollars to raise 10 million dollars to pay 2 million dollars to some top shit exchanges for listing your token, whose 80% volume is wash trading. And you suckers, when you wash trade , can you hit my order once instead of just trading the orders above and below me, so that it looks a bit legit. And you shameless Ass holes keep doing it all day, 24 X 7 X 365. 

</p><br>
<h3>Team details matter, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h3><br>

<p>If you have to put pics of people stolen from social media that can be traced back using online reverse search tools, it's better to have a picture of a laughing cat, from pixabay. </p>

<p>You are going to run away with their money, atleast give them some reason to smile.</p>

<center><img src="assets/eyes.png" alt="">
<b>(I was exit scammed, 11 fucking times past month. Can u imagine, 11 fucking times! This is a Satire Mother Fucker.)</b></center><br>

<p>Ohh and did you knew there are some mother fuckers on Bitcointalk , who spend 28 hours a day reverse spying your team images and posting in scam accusation section on bitcointalk. Someone tell these low life fagots to stop wasting time searching for plagiarism on ICO and Presales website as they can buy Bitcointalk merit points for $5 on Fiverr.

<h2>Mother Fucking 10000% ROI</h2><br>

<p>And let's not forget presales and exit scams. </p>

<p>
You launch a token with fucking 10000% ROI , I invest 1 BTC because an Asshole on Twitter with 100k+ followers told me to do so. 
Next day , your Discord, website, github all is gone and my 1 BTC is now zero. </p>
<center><img src="assets/gone.gif" /></center><br>
<p>Can somebody fucking make me understand, how investing in a coin with 10000% ROI converts 1 BTC to 0 overnight. I mean what kind of out of the world mother fucking math is this.
</p><br>

<h3>Yes, this continues to be fucking satirical, fuckers</h3><br>

<p>You grotesque pile of shit, stop creating these Bitcoin red, Bitcoin Black, Bitcoin XYZ, Bitcoin Blue, Bitcoin Bla, Bitcoin Fuck, Bitcoin Ass, Bitcoin Dick , Ethereum Nova, Ethereum Diamond, 
Dash green clones. </p>

<p>Comeon Motherfucker , apart from changing few parameters in chainparams.cpp atleast use your fucking mind to think of an original name, you bloody cunt. 
And even then your code is filled with bugs. Masternode Payments don't work, POS is fucked up,  wallet has syncing issues, your chain splits etc etc 
and you tell people it's advanced security features you have implemented. You fucking Liar!
</p>


<p>Stop cloning these Ass-Blastered coins, for God sake. A shitcoin without "Bitcoin" in the name is still legible and gets your fucking point across.</p>
